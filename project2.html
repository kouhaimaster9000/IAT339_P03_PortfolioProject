      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>
        For IAT167: Digital Games - Genre, Structure, Programming and Play, we were tasked with creating a
        game that had 3 different levels, each level getting harder than the last. It is a solo project, and we had to
        create it using the Processing programming language and implementing many coding principles that we had learned
        in the duration of the course.
      </p>

      <h3>ROLE</h3>
      <p>
        Since the project was a solo project, I was the main programmer as well as the main illustrator for all of the
        assets in the game.
      </p>

      <h3>PROCESS</h3>

      <p>One of the first tasks I had to do was create a storyboard of how I wanted the game to look like, as shown in Figure 2. While it was not required, I wanted to create characters that existed in the game, so I took note of that when drawing the storyboard, as well as how the game would play out. </p>

      <p class = "centered">Figure 2: Storyboard of the overall concept of game and assets I had to illustrate.</p>

      <p>
        I then created sprites for the character as shown in Figure 3. 
      </p>

      <p>
        While there were no requirements for multiple endings depending on your score, I wanted to challenge myself and create 8 different endings for this mini game. However, it also ended up being one of my biggest struggles, as 8 different endings meant I also had to draw 8 different ending illustrations. I struggled to manage my time in between drawing the different endings, but my solution to that was make the compositions more simple rather than complex. Figures 4 to 9 shows the steps I took to creating one of the ending illustrations.

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
        I felt as if the project was a success. While I had received praise for my quality of work, I felt as if I was too ambitious with this project which was the source of my struggles. The project scope was somewhat small, but I had made goals that were too big and I struggled to meet the quality of some of my own expectations. Perhaps, next time I should think of ways to scope down my project instead of adding more details. However, despite that I worked out a solution and I feel as if it was a personal success as it is a project that I am still very proud of.
