      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>For IAT313: Narrative and New Media, we were tasked with creating an interactive story that has more than one
        linear plotline and multiple endings. We had to create this project in a group of four, and develop and
        establish a narrative that the player could control with the choices given to them like a ‘choose your
        adventure’ story. While the approach to the project was flexible, the main outcome was to create a non-linear
        story. My group chose to create our story in the form of a visual novel-style game.</p>
      <h3>ROLE</h3>
      <p>My roles in the project were as the character designer and main illustrator. While the character designs were
        split between another member and myself, I was tasked with designing the main protagonists of the game. I also
        did the main illustration for the game</p>
      <h3>PROCESS</h3>
      <p>
        My first task was to design the main protagonists: Leo and Lyra. When designing Leo and Lyra, I wanted to create
        a sense of individuality from them both. Leo has a more calm and level headed personality, while Lyra is much
        more outgoing. Thus Leo’s design was based on much cooler colours, while Lyra’s is based on much warmer and
        upbeat colours. By assigning Leo and Lyra character images, I could associate them much more easily as well.
        Because I created their designs, I had to create reference sheets for the line artists of the project to
        reference off as shown in Figure 2.
      </p>

      <p class = "centered">Figure 2: Design sheet for the protagonists.</p>
      <p>
        The next task was to create the main visual illustration, after I had designed the protagonists. Initially, I
        had struggled with the composition of the illustration because I was unsure of how and where to place the
        characters. The main visual illustration is the illustration the player will first see when they start the game,
        so I wanted to be impactful yet succinct. The process is shown in the clickable tab gallery below. 
      </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <img src="img/313-process1.png" alt="Part 1: Rough Sketch" onclick="myFunction(this);">
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <img src="img/313-process2.png" alt="Part 2: Clean Line Art" onclick="myFunction(this);">
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <img src="img/313-process3.png" alt="Part 3: Blocking in Base Colour" onclick="myFunction(this);">
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <img src="img/313-process4.png" alt="Part 4: Colouring of Head" onclick="myFunction(this);">

          <div class="col">
            <img src="img/313-process5.png" alt="Part 5: Colouring of Clothes" onclick="myFunction(this);">
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <img src="img/313-process6.png" alt="Part 6: Adding in Background and Light Source" onclick="myFunction(this);">
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="expand">
          <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="close">&times;</span>
          <img id="fullSizeImage" src = "data:," alt = "empty src and used to display image in full size">
          <div id="imgtext"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the end, I chose to create an illustration of the two main protagonists, Leo and Lyra, accompanied with the
        background of one of the scenes from the ending (Figure 3), so that when the player gets to the ending of one of the
        routes, they would be able to connect the scene to the main visual.

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, the project was a success as it was well received by the professor and teaching assistant who oversaw
        the project. I also feel as if it was a personal success as well, as I was proud of the character design I came
        up with that fit within the world of the story we created. The main visual illustration I had created is also
        still one of my favorite pieces of works I have managed to create in a long time. However, there are things that
        I think could’ve been better, due to the time restraints that we were given-- as most of our group had differing
        schedules, a lot of the work done ended up being finished near the deadline. Had we been given more time, I
        think that I could’ve refined a lot more things.
